# Zepto Grocery Sales Analytics

📊 **End-to-End Data Analytics Project using SQL + Power BI**

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project analyzes grocery sales data to uncover key business insights.  
I prepared data using **T-SQL**, built KPIs, and designed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for decision-making.

1. **Business Objective** – Understand sales drivers by product, outlet, and region.
2. **Data Preparation (SQL)**  
   - Cleaned inconsistent labels  
   - Built KPIs (Total Sales, Avg Sales, Items Sold, Avg Rating)  
   - Aggregated by fat content, outlet type, location, and year
3. **Visualization (Power BI)**  
   - KPI Cards  
   - Revenue by Fat Content  
   - Sales by Outlet Type, Location, and Size  
   - Growth Trends by Year
